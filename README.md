# Greetings

Thankyou for viewing my project! This project was created as a tech demo to illustrate the evolution in the way I create front-ends, namely with the standardization of my usage of CSS (the contrast is especially apparent when compared to my previous consultancy project).

It currently has the following key features:
- Hybrid BEM and CUBE CSS architecture (using BEM structure to create blocks and element groups whilst utilising utility classes specific elements)
- Responsive design primarily using rem and vh/vw units and clamp() and very minimal breakpoints

Overtime I may add more to this project or even turn it into a full scale project depending on the features I'd like to intergrate.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
